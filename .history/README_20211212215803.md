# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard that uses [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve the current weather, as well as a five-day forecast.

## Functionality

* Type any city into the search bar and submit.
* The dashboard will display today's date, current sky condition (sunny, cloudy, etc.), temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index.
* Below today's weather is a five-day forecast showing predicted conditions, temperatures, and humidity.
* Cities you search for will be saved and displayed as buttons, and can be clicked on to quickly return to that city's weather.
* Click the "clear history" button to remove all cities from your search history.
